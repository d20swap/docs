# DRC20

## Whats DRC-20 ?

DRC-20 is an experimental token standard that enables the minting and transferring of fungible tokens through the Unielon protocol on the Bitcoin chain.

Drawing inspiration from Ethereum's ERC-20 tokens, DRC-20 tokens have different mechanisms and functionalities. DRC-20 tokens are still in the experimental phase, and users should exercise extreme caution.

### How Were DRC-20 Tokens Created?

After the launch of the Bitcoin Ordinals protocol in January 2023, which allowed for the inscription of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on satoshis (sats), there was curiosity about whether fungible tokens could be created on the Bitcoin network. In March 2023, the BRC-20 token standard was created by a pseudonymous programmer named Domo, enabling the minting of fungible tokens on Bitcoin. The first deployed BRC-20 token was called "ordi." Bitcoin wallets swiftly deployed tools to support BRC-20 tokens. In the following months, numerous other BRC-20 tokens, many of which were meme tokens, were launched. As of May 2023, some BRC-20 tokens have experienced astronomical price increases and gained significant market capitalization. The demand for BRC-20 tokens has led to a surge in Bitcoin transaction fees and significant congestion on the Bitcoin network.

The Dogecoin community, known for its innovative spirit, saw the success of BRC-20 tokens and initiated the development of the DRC-20 standard protocol.

### How Do DRC-20 Tokens Work?

Understanding how Bitcoin Ordinals work is important for a better understanding of DRC-20 tokens. The Ordinals protocol is a system for numbering satoshis and allows users to attach additional data to satoshis through a process called "inscription."

Ordinals is a protocol on the Bitcoin network, and Dogecoin [Unielon](https://unielon.com/), as a derivative of Dogecoin, utilizes the foundational standards of Ordinals to develop more practical features.

DRC-20 tokens utilize Ordinals inscriptions of JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) data to deploy token contracts, mint, and transfer tokens. Currently, the DRC-20 token standard allows for the creation of DRC-20 tokens through the deploy function, minting a specified quantity of DRC-20 tokens through the mint function, and transferring a specified quantity of DRC-20 tokens through the transfer function.

The DRC-20 token standard is relatively new, and the process of deploying, minting, and transferring DRC-20 tokens is not very user-friendly. Additionally, there are limited tools and supporting services available.



### Differences Between DRC-20 and ERC-20 Tokens

Despite the similarity in their names, there are significant differences between the two tokens.

DRC-20 tokens exist on the Dogecoin network, while ERC-20 is a standard on the Ethereum network. DRC-20 tokens don't use [smart contracts](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-are-smart-contracts) and, therefore, have much less functionality. On the contrary, ERC-20 tokens can interact with other protocols and applications to enable a wide range of services, including borrowing and lending.

ERC-20 is a mature token standard with a massive number of ERC-20 tokens already created and widely used. Conceived in 2015 and officially recognized in 2017, ERC-20 tokens have been battle-tested and proven to function stably. That's not the case with DRC-20 tokens, whose future has a high degree of uncertainty.

### Risks of DRC-20 Tokens

The DRC-20 token standard is currently an experiment by programmers to facilitate fungibility on the Dogecoin blockchain. As it's still being tested, many things could go wrong.

Despite the hype, DRC-20 tokens have little utility at present. The outlook is also highly questionable. Due to the ease of minting DRC-20 tokens, it's possible that most could end up being worthless. Users and investors should be cautious and conduct proper research before engaging with this new token type.&#x20;
